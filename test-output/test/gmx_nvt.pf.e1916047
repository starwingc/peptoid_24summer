Back Off! I just backed up md.log to ./#md.log.2#
Compiled SIMD: SSE4.1, but for this host/run AVX2_256 might be better (see
log).
Reading file nvt.tpr, VERSION 2021.2 (single precision)
Changing nstlist from 10 to 100, rlist from 1 to 1

Using 4 MPI threads
Using 1 OpenMP thread per tMPI thread


NOTE: The number of threads is not equal to the number of (logical) cores
      and the -pin option is set to auto: will not pin threads to cores.
      This can lead to significant performance degradation.
      Consider using -pin on (and -pinoffset in case you run multiple jobs).

Back Off! I just backed up traj.trr to ./#traj.trr.2#

Back Off! I just backed up ener.edr to ./#ener.edr.2#

Program:     gmx mdrun, version 2021.2
Source file: src/gromacs/ewald/pme_redistribute.cpp (line 305)
MPI rank:    2 (out of 4)

Fatal error:
2672 particles communicated to PME rank 2 are more than 2/3 times the cut-off
out of the domain decomposition cell of their charge group in dimension x.
This usually means that your system is not well equilibrated.
